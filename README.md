What is Dork?
----------------

Dork is both a decentralized memecoin and the open‑source software that powers it. The currency uses a Proof of Stake 3.0 (PoSV3 / BPoS) consensus to deliver near‑instant transactions with negligible fees, while sofware Dork builds on Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 (with selected patches from newer releases) to provide improved performance, broader third‑party compatibility, and a hardened, feature‑rich foundation for wallets and nodes.

Who are the Dorks?
----------------
Dorks are a fun-loving community of nerds who don’t take life too seriously. They’re all about good vibes, clever memes, and having a laugh while exploring the wild world of crypto. Just a bunch of Dorks turning internet culture into digital gold.
